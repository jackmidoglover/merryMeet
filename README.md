# Merry Meet

A location-based social networking app for pagans and wiccans. See it [here](https://aqueous-savannah-50488.herokuapp.com/)!

## Motivation

As various pagan religions and Wicca have grown in popularity over the past five years there has been a growing demand by solitary practitioners looking to meet other pagans in their community. This desire to meet other pagans competes with an equal desire by most pagans to remain on the "down-low" due to various stigmas (be it villifying or simply silly) related to their spiritual beliefs. 

Merry Meet seeks to bridge the gap between these two competing demands and help build a visual, interactive community by creating a location-based chatroom experience. A user can drop a pin with a symbol representing their beliefs at a particular location (maybe a favorite coffee shop, or occult book store). By dropping the pin they initiate a chatroom, where they and other pagans can share their thoughts. Like a wall in Facebook, users can share their stories and feelings, but are restricted to that particular location, meaning in order to access it you have to go there. This design will hopefully facilitate face-to-face encounters. However, unlike facebook, Merry Meet does not require a ton of personal information. You do not have to divulge your real name or post a picture of yourself, allowing users to control how public or private they are. 

## Production Status

Merry Meet is still being debugged, but currently offers all basic features.
